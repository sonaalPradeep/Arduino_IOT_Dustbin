This project was made for our Environmental Studies course, to show a way in which CSED students could implement solutions to help save the environment. Our solution was to implement a very simple version of the 'smart bin', the new and modern dustin which were implemented in Singapore. The original dustbin where more advanced, having solar panels, transmitters, compressors to mention some of them. But with this project, I wish to implement just the basic operation, which is to send a message to your phone if the dustbin gets close to getting filled. 
            
For this project, I used...
* Arduino Uno
* BLuetooth module
* Ultrasonic sensor
* Breadboard
* Connecting wires
